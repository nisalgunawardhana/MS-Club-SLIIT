# MS Club Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As dedicated members, contributors, and leaders of the MS Club, we commit to fostering a vibrant community where every individual feels valued and respected. We strive to create an environment free from harassment and discrimination, embracing the rich diversity of our members.

Regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, educational background, socio-economic status, personal appearance, race, or religion, we honor the unique perspectives and experiences that each person brings to our community.

We pledge to engage with one another in a spirit of kindness and collaboration, actively working to build a culture of openness, support, and inclusion. Together, we aim to cultivate a space where everyone can thrive and contribute to the collective growth of our community.

## Our Standards

Positive Behavior
* Supportive Collaboration: Engage with a spirit of generosity, always looking to uplift and assist fellow members. We encourage helping others, whether it's in coding challenges, brainstorming sessions, or general community involvement.
* Celebrating Diverse Perspectives: Appreciate and respect the different experiences and viewpoints our members bring. Thoughtful dialogue is at the heart of what makes our community innovative and thriving.
* Constructive Growth: Offer feedback that helps others grow, and be open to receiving feedback with humility. We value feedback that aims to strengthen both the individual and the community.
* Ownership and Integrity: Own your actions, and when mistakes happen, be ready to make amends. We are all human and learn by taking responsibility and moving forward.
* Community-First Mindset: Strive for decisions and actions that benefit the collective. Prioritize the success and well-being of the community as a whole, beyond individual gains.

Unacceptable Behavior
* Sexualization of Space: Any behavior, language, or imagery that objectifies or sexualizes others is strictly prohibited. We maintain a respectful, professional atmosphere where everyone feels safe.
* Disruptive Behavior: Trolling, harassment, and derogatory remarks that disrupt the flow of constructive discourse will not be tolerated. This includes inflammatory statements or harmful personal attacks.
* Intrusive Privacy Violations: Sharing private information without permission—whether it's personal data, contact information, or any form of private communication—violates the trust of our members.
* Hostile or Aggressive Conduct: Any behavior that intimidates, bullies, or aggressively silences others, whether in public or private interactions, is unacceptable.
* Professionalism: Any actions or comments that are not appropriate in a learning or professional environment, including personal vendettas, political manipulation, or unwarranted negativity, are not welcome here.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The leadership team of the MS Club at SLIIT University is dedicated to upholding a safe and constructive environment for all members. Our responsibilities include:
* Active Monitoring: Community leaders will proactively monitor interactions within the club's channels—be it during meetings, on social media, or through project collaborations—to ensure adherence to our Code of Conduct.
* Immediate Response: If a member's behavior is perceived as inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful, community leaders are committed to promptly addressing the situation. This could involve initiating a conversation to clarify concerns or temporarily suspending engagement with the member in question while the issue is assessed.
* Guided Decision-Making: When determining appropriate actions, leaders will consider the specific context of the incident, focusing on restorative practices that encourage learning and growth rather than punitive measures. Our aim is to resolve conflicts constructively and foster understanding.
* Empowering Communication: Leaders are encouraged to communicate openly about moderation decisions. Whenever a comment, code contribution, or any form of input is removed or altered, the reasoning behind such actions will be shared with the community to promote transparency.
* Supportive Environment: We recognize that everyone can learn and grow from their mistakes. Thus, community leaders will work closely with individuals involved in incidents to provide guidance on expected behaviors and ensure they feel supported in their journey to contribute positively.
* Confidentiality and Respect: All reports and discussions regarding unacceptable behavior will be handled with discretion. The privacy and security of all parties involved will be respected, ensuring that members feel safe to voice concerns without fear of retaliation.

## Scope

* Club Meetings and Events: Any gatherings, workshops, or discussions organized by the MS Club, whether held on-campus or off-site, are governed by this Code. This includes both formal and informal settings where members interact.
* Digital Communication: All forms of communication related to the club, including emails, group chats, and posts on social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Discord), are subject to the guidelines outlined here.
